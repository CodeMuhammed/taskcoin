THE PITCH
=========

1. DISCOVERY
My first peek into the world of software development was some four years back when i accidentally downloaded a python shell on my nokia symbian phone because
I thought it was a snake game. I launched the app and discovered something entirely different. Then i went online, researched about it and started following
through with the online tutorial on my phone. it wasn't long before i built my first commandline-powered calculator app.In retrospect, That was where my passion for software dev started. Coupled with the realization that i had a turing complete tool in my hands that can be used to model anything within the grasp of my imagination, I went on a learning quest by taking series of online courses on programming from stanford. free courseware and coursera.

2. SUCCESS STORY
The highlight of my journey as an avid sofware developer was being a part of a rag-tag team who came out second runner up twice in the clash of the campuses-
A software exhibition program organised by paradigm initiative Nigeria.

3. CAREER GROWTH
I have always wanted to work in a real team,, working on real-life projects, and collaborating with creative young minds with a singualar mantra of excellence and changing the world. Which makes the Andela model perfect.
