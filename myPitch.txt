TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

1. DISCOVERY
My first peek into the world of software development was some four years back when i accidentally downloaded a python shell on my nokia symbian phone because
I thought it was a snake game. I launched the app and discovered something entirely different. Then i went online, researched about it and started following
through with the online tutorial on my phone. it wasn't long before i built my first commandline-powered calculator app.In retrospect, That was where my passion for software dev started. Coupled with the realization that i had a turing complete tool in my hands that can be used to model anything within the grasp of my imagination, I went on a learning quest by taking series of online courses on programming from stanford. free courseware and coursera.

2. SUCCESS STORY
The highlight of my journey as a budding sofware developer was being a part of a rag-tag team who came out second runner up twice in the clash of the campuses-
A software exhibition program organised by paradigm initiative Nigeria.

3. CAREER GROWTH
I have always wanted to work in a real team, working on real-life projects, and collaborating with creative young minds 
with a singualar mantra of excellence and changing the world. Which makes the Andela model perfect.
